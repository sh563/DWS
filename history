									DWS Wine Group is the home of Chinese family of companies. Each business is bound together around a mission to MAKE LIFE MORE JOYFUL and our family values known by the acronym R.E.A.C.H. - Respect, Evolution, Adventure, Character, & Humility. 

									​
									
									Whether in wine, hospitality, or event production, we strive to create JOY
									
									for our customers, our team, our community, and the world.
									

									DWS Wine Group is the realization of our vision to tell stories through wine.

 

                                    We built careers in some of the largest, most successful wine companies in the world, 
                                    but that sometimes meant toeing the company line rather than doing what was right for our relationships,
                                    our brands, or the health of the business. 
  									So we set out to build a company that would put those things first.
  									Building a new company has been the hardest work we’ve ever done, 
  									but we feel lucky to work with people we trust, sell wines that we believe in, 
  									and make the decisions that we feel are good, not just beneficial.
